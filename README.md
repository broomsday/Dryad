You've inherited your grandmothers old cafe.  But in a world where a layer of smog hides the sun and ultra-violet light scorches above, it's hard to make interesting snacks for people.

You discover an old path behind the cafe that leads to your grandmother's old garden, now covered in polluted debris.

Spend your days making money at the cafe and then at night venture above the clouds to restore the garden, unlocking new ingredients (vegetables and fruits) and decorations (flowers).

Be careful to rest though!
